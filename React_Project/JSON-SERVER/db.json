A mother produces milk, and that milk was specifically designed for their baby, a human.</p><p>However, within 1-3 days after birth, most dairy farms take calves from their moms. Why would they do such a horrible act? You can thus consume milk, cheese, and yogurt. Although the milk was meant for the calf's infant, it is currently being devoured by people.</p><p>What transpires to the infant who was yanked from its mother now? Accordingly, female calves frequently suffer the same heinous destiny as their mothers. When they are old enough, they are bred or artificially sexed. After having their children taken away from them, they are used as milk machines until they are unable to produce milk any more, at which point they are killed.</p><p>Male calves are abducted, stall-raised for veal while shackled.</p>",

The&nbsp;batting&nbsp;side scores&nbsp;runs&nbsp;by striking the&nbsp;ball&nbsp;bowled&nbsp;at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and&nbsp;fielding&nbsp;side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and&nbsp;dismiss&nbsp;each batter (so they are \"out\"). Means of dismissal include being&nbsp;bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either&nbsp;catching&nbsp;the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the&nbsp;crease&nbsp;in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the&nbsp;innings&nbsp;ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two&nbsp;umpires, aided by a&nbsp;third umpire&nbsp;and&nbsp;match referee&nbsp;in international matches.
